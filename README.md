# NodeBot
NodeBot is a bot written by Green Tea on 11/27/2019. This repository only
includes a few commands that are used mainly by admins. The permission system
that this bot uses is a 3 level system, where there are banned users, regular
users, and admin users. Bots that I have created after this use mainly 4 level
permission systems where there are banned users, regular users, moderators, and
owners. Commands can be added into the bot.js script at the bottom.

To use this bot, download the repository, make sure that the dependencies are
installed, and run `node bot.js` in the Node folder. You can add some commands
into the code if you need to and the location to add the code is at the bottom
of the bot.js script.
